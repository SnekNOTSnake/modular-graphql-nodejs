# Unsolved Mysteries

1. Mongoose Connection `promiseLibrary` in `src/index.js`
2. Throng thing that's used to start the server from `src/index.js`
3. How `src/modules/index.js` works
4. The `me` resolver returns a strange user with `_doc` instead of just returning the user object in `src/modules/auth/resolvers/me.js` (Probably just an old code, we can now use the first case I think)
5. Just throwing a caught error is unnecessary (The ESLint says so)
